# simpteachcs

some simple teaching ideas for cs concepts

* shunting algorithm and RPN evaluator, add tokenizer/parsing concepts
* recurrence solver
* jump/goto/procedure tail call optimization example with assembly/machine code/or wasm
* optimal permutation generation
* optimal set intersection
* write your own visualization and instrumentation/profiling
* prove complexity analysis with gas
